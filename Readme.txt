This study proposes a method for identifying salt-alkali tolerant rice varieties by integrating hyperspectral feature optimization and machine learning algorithms. Using 12 rice varieties grown in saline-alkali soil in Ningxia as the research objects, hyperspectral data of leaves were collected at the grain-filling stage, and 33 spectral feature parameters were extracted. Ten key feature subsets, including green peak position and red edge position, were selected using the MRMR algorithm. By comparing five classification models—BPNN, SVM, KNN, RNN, and RF—it was found that the KNN model based on the 10 optimized features performed the best, achieving a test set classification accuracy of 92.62% and a Kappa coefficient of 91.42%. This method not only enables efficient and non-destructive variety identification but also enhances the interpretability of the model due to the clear physiological significance of the selected features, providing reliable technical support for the screening of salt-tolerant rice varieties and precision breeding.
